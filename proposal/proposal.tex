\section{Summary}

We are going to implement an optimized object tracker on NVIDIA GPUs using the SCM algorithm. The goal is to perform real-time object tracking.

\section{Background}

There are four main parts in a tracking algorithm (according to \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1303-4803}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Object initialization: choosing what regions of an initial image corresponds to the objects to track.
    \item Appearance modelling: choosing how to represent visiually and statistically the features of the objects to track compared to the background.
    \item Motion estimation: determining what parts of the image have moved compared to the previous one.
    \item Object localization: localize the tracked objects on the new image.
\end{itemize}

The appearance modelling and motion estimation phase consists in statistical learning and optimization. We will base the appearance modelling part of our implementation on the SCM algorithm \cite{6247882}, which has been implemented in Matlab only by its authors. Although the paper only concerns the appearance modelling phase, it is designed to work with a particle filter for the motion estimation phase.

The SCM algorithm is described as follows by its authors: \enquote{We develop a sparsity-based discriminative classifier (SDC) and a sparsity-based generative model (SGM). In the SDC module, we introduce an effective method to compute the confidence value that assigns more weights to the foreground than the background. In the SGM module, we propose a novel histogram-based method that takes the spatial information of each patch into consideration with an occlusion handing scheme}.


\section{The challenge}

The main dependency is temporal: you need to examine the frames in order, each one after the other. However, the algorithm present some points of synchronization that prevent total parallelization. The size of the working data is not that big (we only work one one image at a time) but the complexity of the computations in the algorithm is relatively low, so the dominant factor between data access and computation is unclear.

The challenge is then to optimize the parallelization rate of the algorithm, find out the bottlenecks and try to overcome them. In particular, we need to identify which is the slowest part of the four; if for instance motion estimation is slower than appearance modeling then we would spend more time optimizing it. Moreover, the goal is to perform the computation in real time with the best framerate possible (with a decent resolution).

\section{Ressources}

We will use the \href{http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/project/cvpr12_scm.files/cvpr12_wei_code.zip}{Matlab SCM code} as a starting point (to translate to C++ and CUDA), and use OpenCV functions for the parts of the algorithm that we don't want to optimize.

We will use the GPUs of the GHC machines to run our program. If we make enough progress, we could try to test our program on the NSH camera with the Tegra X1 attached to it.

\section{Goals and deliverables}

\subsection{Primary goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Having a correct sequential implementation of the algorithm using C++ (correctness compared with the Matlab SCM program).
    \item Analyse the workload and determine which bottlenecks we need to parallelize in CUDA.
    \item Parallelize, verify correctness, compute speedup compared to sequential implementation.
    \item Analyse the result of our implementation on the \href{http://ci2cv.net/nfs/index.html}{Need for speed dataset} and compute the equivalent framerate at which our algorithm is capable of tracking the object.
\end{itemize}

The main grading criteria would be the framerate reach by our parallel algorithm.

\subsection{Additional goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find or implement an initialization front-end to trace bounding boxes around objects to track.
    \item Depending on the performance of the algorithm, use our program to actually track objects in real time from a camera feed using the initialization front-end.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Platform choice}

C++, CUDA, GPU and the OpenCV framework are sensible choices for image processing applications.
