\begin{abstract}
We are going to implement an optimized object tracker on NVIDIA GPUs. The goal is to perform real-time object tracking. Here is the link to our \href{https://github.com/denismerigoux/GPU-tracking}{GitHub repository}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Changes from initial proposal}

After having reviewed \cite{6247882} which presented the SCM algorithm we wanted to implement, we realized that the code provided by the authors wasn't a good starting point (Matlab 2009 code running only on a Windows XP virtual machine). Instead, we chose to take as a starting point the code for the KCF tracker \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HenriquesCMB14} for which a sequential implementation exist in OpenCV. Our new goal is to parallelize this tracker to make it run on the GPU, using OpenCV's CUDA framework. Our work could have more potential and unsefulness as part of the OpenCV framework.

\section{Work completed so far}

The first task was to setup a build system, which is not easy given the intricacy of OpenCV, the various options needed to run the tracker or having CUDA support, and the lack of root privileges on the GHC machines. We had to developer various build scripts and try several configurations before reaching an optimal build workflow.

Then we proceeded to implemented a correctness test and a profiling analysis of the tracker code, to monitor our progress when parallelizing the code. We test the tracker on a 141-frames fullHD video, and take the average computing time over all frames for the profiling (see figure \ref{tab}). The analysis of this profiling led us to focus our first efforts into parallelizing the Discrete Fourier transform used by KCF, task still under development since the beginning of the week.

\section{Updated goals}

\subsection{Primary goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Having a correct sequential implementation of the algorithm using C++. \textbf{Done.}
    \item Analyse the workload and determine which bottlenecks we need to parallelize in CUDA. \textbf{Done.}
    \item Parallelize, verify correctness, compute speedup compared to sequential implementation.
    \item Analyse the result of our implementation on the \href{http://ci2cv.net/nfs/index.html}{Need for speed dataset} and compute the equivalent framerate at which our algorithm is capable of tracking the object.
\end{itemize}

The main grading criteria would be the framerate reached by our parallel algorithm.

\subsection{Additional goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find or implement an initialization front-end to trace bounding boxes around objects to track.
    \item Depending on the performance of the algorithm, use our program to actually track objects in real time from a camera feed using the initialization front-end.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallelism competition}

We may present a graph showing plotting the average time taken to update one frame by the sequential algorithm and our parallelized algorithm, against the resolution of the video (larger resolutions should yield more opportunity for parallelism).
