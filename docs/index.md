# Parallel KCF Tracking
_A 15-618 Final Project by Ila√Ø Deutel and Denis Merigoux_

## Summary

We are implementing an optimized object tracker on NVIDIA GPUs using the [KCF algorithm](http://home.isr.uc.pt/~pedromartins/Publications/henriques_eccv2012.pdf). The goal is to perform real-time object tracking with a simple OpenCV interface (using the [OpenCV Tracking API](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d9/df8/group__tracking.html)).

## The challenge

The main dependency is temporal: you need to examine the frames in order, each one after the other. However, the algorithm present some points of synchronization that prevent total parallelization. The size of the working data is not that big (we only work one image at a time) but the complexity of the computations in the algorithm is relatively low, so the dominant factor between data access and computation is unclear.

The challenge is then to optimize the parallelization rate of the algorithm, find out the bottlenecks and try to overcome them The goal is to perform the computation in real time with the best framerate possible (with a decent resolution).

## Correctness and performance analysis

We have built a correctness and performance analysis engine, which shows performance per task (averaged over the number of frames) updated in real time, and stop if the parallel solution is not correct. We determine if the solution is correct by comparing the bounding boxes returned by the parallel implementation with those returned by the sequential implementation. They must be *exactly* the same (no approximation).

Example of output for an incorrect implementation:
```
=== Sequential ===
// Performance information for the 189 frames of the video, not shown here
=== Parallel ===
// Performance information for the first 4 frames of the video, not shown here
Correctness failed at frame 3
Bounding box mismatch:
* Sequential: [286 x 720 from (635, 219)]
* Parallel: [286 x 720 from (635, 221)]
```

## Analyzing performance of the sequential implementation

The table below gives the time, averaged over the number of frames after the first frame (which serves as initialization), taken by the baseline sequential algorithm for each subtask:

## Preliminary results

Given the timing results on the sequential algorithm, we have decided to start improving the performance of [`denseGaussKernel`](https://github.com/denismerigoux/GPU-tracking/blob/master/src/trackerKCF.cpp), which is called in both the _Compute the gaussian kernel_ and _Calculate alphas_ phases.

This function uses calls to [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) and inverse FFT, therefore we have decided to use [the NVIDIA CUDA Fast Fourier Transform library (cuFFT)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufft).

We have also implemented a parallel version of `updateProjectionMatrix`, which involves a very large matrix multiplication.

We have written custom kernels for function `extractCN`, which extracts color names for patches.

Our parallel implementation yield the following results:

| Phase | Subtask | Time taken |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Detection | Extract and pre-process the patch | 1.092 ms |
|  | Non-compressed custom descriptors | 0.193 ms |
|  | **Compressed descriptors** | **3.112 ms** |
|  | Compressed custom descritors | 2.809 ms |
|  | Compress features and KRSL | 8.910 ms |
|  | Merge all features | 1.559 ms |
|  | **Compute the gaussian kernel** | **10.724 ms** |
|  | Compute the FFT | 1.833 ms |
|  | Calculate filter response | 3.155 ms |
|  | Extract maximum response | 0.237 ms |
|  | *Total* | *33.623 ms* |

|  | Non-compressed descriptors | 1.005 ms |
|  | Non-compressed custom descriptors | 0.193 ms |
|  | **Compressed descriptors** | **3.106 ms** |
|  | Compressed custom descriptors | 3.500 ms |
|  | Update training data | 2.970 ms |
|  | *Total* | *10.686 ms* |
| Feature compression | **Update projection matrix** | **13.403 ms** |
|  | Compress | 4.280 ms |
|  | Merge all features | 0.712 ms |
|  | *Total* | *17.382 ms* |
| Least Squares Regression | Initialization | 0.000 ms |
|  | **Calculate alphas** | **11.783 ms** |
|  | Compute FFT | 1.841 ms |
|  | Add a small value | 0.398 ms |

|  | Update RLS model | 0.847 ms |
|  | *Total* | *14.633 ms* |
| Total time for a frame | ****** | ***77.848 ms*** |

Speedup: **x1.42**. We can track object at a rate of **12.4 frames per second** in FullHD using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080, versus 8.7 frames per second with the sequential version.

## Ressources

We have used the [sequential KCF OpenCV implementation](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d2/dff/classcv_1_1TrackerKCF.html) as a starting point. We are using the GPUs of the GHC machines to run our program.
